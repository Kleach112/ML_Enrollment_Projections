# School Enrollment Forecasting Project

## Overview
This project aims to forecast 10-year school enrollment for the Springfield R-XII School District using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide more accurate and nuanced predictions than traditional methods, aiding in resource allocation, policy planning, and infrastructure development.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the project.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- `models/`: Trained model files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of package dependencies for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Includes sensitive data, environment files, and system-specific files that are not part of the source code.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was developed using Python 3.8. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment:
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  .venvCap\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On Unix or MacOS:
  ```
  source .venvCap/bin/activate
  ```
4. Install the required packages:

## Packages Installed
The following Python packages are essential for this project and have been installed:

- `numpy`: For numerical computations and array operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For making attractive and informative statistical graphics.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.

## Usage
This project consists of Python scripts that perform data processing, analysis, and model training. Follow the steps below to run the main script:
